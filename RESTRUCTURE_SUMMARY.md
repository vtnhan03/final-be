### 📋 Key Improvements

#### 1. **Layered Architecture**
- **API Layer**: Clean separation of endpoints by functionality
- **Service Layer**: Business logic isolated from HTTP concerns
- **Data Layer**: Database models and access patterns
- **Auth Layer**: Authentication and authorization logic
- **Utils Layer**: Shared utilities and helpers

#### 2. **Better Code Organization**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper use of FastAPI's DI system
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints throughout the codebase
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses and status codes

#### 3. **Scalability Features**
- **Versioned APIs**: `/api/v1/` structure for future versions
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add new features and endpoints
- **Service Pattern**: Business logic can be reused across endpoints
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized settings with environment variables

#### 4. **Security Enhancements**
- **JWT Authentication**: Proper token-based authentication
- **Google OAuth**: Secure Google authentication integration
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with validation
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing
